## Problem Statement 

Atliq, a hardware company supplying peripherals across India, grapples with a significant problem: a notable decline in sales. Despite having regional offices in various states and a central office in Delhi, the sales director faces challenges in pinpointing the reasons behind the downturn. Communication breakdowns further complicate the issue, as regional managers paint an overly optimistic picture, obscuring the true business landscape. The absence of data insights exacerbates the challenge, leaving the sales director frustrated and unable to make informed decisions.

Compounding the issue, the sales director encounters difficulties in obtaining actionable information from regional managers. Instead of concise insights, he receives extensive Excel files, overwhelming him with excessive numerical data. As humans are not adept at processing vast amounts of information, the director is left grappling with the complexity of the reports. 

To address this critical situation, Atliq urgently needs a streamlined, user-friendly solution for data analysis, enabling the sales director to derive simple yet insightful conclusions and effectively address the underlying issues impacting sales performance.
